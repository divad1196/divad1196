## Languages

* English (officially B2, evaluated C1)
* German (officially B1, had reached level B2)
* Italian (estimated A1-A2)
* (Portugeis: able to undestand and speak a bit)


## Programming languages
* **Python**: My default language. I think I master all of its current features.
  * Web: I use Flask/Fastapi the most, but I also did use Django.
  * I mainly create tools and scripting to manage systems and APIs.
  * I also use it for Data management (gathering, cleaning, storing, ... sometimes ploting) using panda, numpy, request, json, lxml, ....
* **Rust**: This is now my favorite language. I love the macros, the syntax and how the functional paradigm is used. I am now almost as proefficient using Rust than using Python.
* **Javascript**: I have used vanilla javascript and jquery a lot (not by choice). I often use it when I need a graphical interface.  
  I have used Vuejs (default choice), React (liked it best), AlpineJs (for POC-ing, or when I don't need much)
* **C++**: My first love. I still practice it by myself but never had the luck to work professionnaly on it.
  I have used Qt, SFML a long time ago and did a lot of Data Structure and Algorithm on it.
* **Java**: I did it a lot (almost every coding course for 4 years used java). I used SpringBoot and Swing libraries/frameworks and did a lot of DSA.
* **Bash**: Fluent with basic scripting, loops, streams, ... I use find/grep/sed/awk/... and many others regulary (I may need to have a refresh sometimes)


I also tried ruby (+ruby-on-rails), php, haskell, elixir and golang by doing 1 projects for each of them. I undestand the notions and would be able to learn them fast.
I have learned all languages I know on the fly to achieve projects and master them after a few weeks of practice. Therefore, I am pretty confident in my capacity to learn new languages.
