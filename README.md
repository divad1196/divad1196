# David Gallay

I am available to anyone having a question about Computer science (as long as I can help you). Just contact me.

## Profil summary
### Main skills
* Real **fullstack developper** except for designing the frontend myself: I don't have any artistic talent.
  But once the design provided, I am able to reproduce it and discuss the UX.
* Linux Sysadmin
* Cloud Engineer
* Security Engineer (Finishing my degree)
* Data Management (gathering, cleaning, ... but not analysing)
* Database:
  * I master postgresql(postgresql' sql, shell, ORM) and have set up a cluster once (PGpool2, repmgr).
  * Generic SQL and RDBMS (Postgresql, Mariadb, ...)
  * NoSQL: Mongodb
* Good networking knowledges (not enough to be called network engineer)

### Skills I absolutely don't have/master enough
* I have used Windows a bit, but I am not comfortable with it (usage and administration).
* I am NOT a designer
* I am NOT a Networking engineer (I won't manage your network good enough to replace one)

### Soft Skills
* Quick learner
* Able to think differently/out-of-the-box and challenge ideas in order to find the best solution


## Social Media
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gallay-4244bb1a7/)


## Languages
* French (mother tongue)
* English (officially B2, evaluated C1)
* German (officially B1, had reached level B2)
* Italian (estimated A1-A2)
* (Portugeis: able to undestand and speak a bit)


## Programming languages
* **C++**: My first love. I still practice it by myself but never have the luck to work professionnaly on it.
  I have used Qt, SFML a long time ago and did a lot of Data Structure and Algorithm on it.
* **Python**: My default language. I think I master all of its current features.
  * Web: I use Flask/Fastapi the most, but I did use Django.
  * I mainly create tools and scripting to manage system and APIs.
  * I also use it for Data management (gathering, cleaning, storing, ... sometimes ploting) I use panda, numpy, request, json, lxml, ... a lot.
* **Javascript**: I have used vanilla javascript and jquery a lot (not by choice). I often use it when I need a graphical interface.  
  I have used Vuejs (default choice), React (liked it best), AlpineJs (for POC-ing, or when I don't need much)
* **Java**: I did it a lot (almost every coding course for 4 years used java).  
  I personnally don't like it even if I understand why it is used professionally and would recommend it depending the team and project.
* **Bash**: Fluent with basic scripting, loops, streams, ... I use find/grep/sed/awk/... and many others regulary (I may need to have a refresh sometimes)
* **Rust**: I know understand all the basics. I am still missing practice but I have projects ongoing in order to fix that.  
  This is also an opportunity to try wasm with yew

I also tried ruby (+ruby-on-rails), php, haskell, elixir and golang one 1 simple projects each. I undestand the notions and would be able to learn them fast.
I have learned all languages I know on the fly to achieve projects and master them after a few weeks of practice. Therefore, I am pretty confident in my capacity to learn new languages.
