# David Gallay

I am available to anyone having a question about Computer science (as long as I can help you). Just contact me.

## Profil summary
* Real **fullstack developper** except for designing the frontend myself: I don't have any artistic talent.
  But once the design provided, I am able to reproduce it and discuss the UX.
* Linux Sysadmin
* Cloud Engineer
* Security Engineer (Finishing my degree)
* Data Management (gathering, cleaning, ... but not analysing)
* Good networking knowledges (not enough to be called network engineer)

I have used windows a bit, but I am not comfortable with it (usage and administration).


## Social Media
* [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-gallay-4244bb1a7/)


## Languages
* French (mother tongue)
* English (officially B2, evaluated C1)
* German (officially B1, had reached level B2)
* Italian (estimated A1-A2)
* (Portugeis: able to undestand and speak a bit)


## Programming languages
* **C++**: My first love. I still practice it by myself but never have the luck to work professionnaly on it.
  I have used Qt, SFML a long time ago and did a lot of Data Structure and Algorithm on it.
* **Python**: My default language. I think I master all of its current features.
  * Web: I use Flask/Fastapi the most, but I did use Django.
  * I mainly create tools and scripting to manage system and APIs.
  * I also use it for Data management (gathering, cleaning, storing, ... sometimes ploting) I use panda, numpy, request, json, lxml, ... a lot.
* **Javascript**: I have used vanilla javascript and jquery a lot (not by choice). I often use it when I need a graphical interface.  
  I have used Vuejs (default choice), React (liked it best), AlpineJs (for POC-ing, or when I don't need much)
* **Java**: I did it a lot (almost every coding course for 4 years used java).  
  I personnally don't like it even if I understand why it is used professionally and would recommend it depending the team and project.
* **Bash**: Fluent with basic scripting, loops, streams, ... I use find/grep/sed/awk/... and many others regulary (I may need to have a refresh sometimes)
* **Rust**: I know understand all the basics. I am still missing practice but I have projects ongoing in order to fix that.  
  This is also an opportunity to try wasm with yew

I also tried ruby (+ruby-on-rails), php, haskell, elixir and golang one 1 simple projects each. I undestand the notions and would be able to learn them fast.
I have learned all languages I know on the fly to achieve projects and master them after a few weeks of practice. Therefore, I am pretty confident in my capacity to learn new languages.


## Other Technical Skills
* System administration on linux (Debian-like mainly, but I also did other linux distributions)
  There are advanced sysadmin skills, like SELinux, I have hardly used. I am looking forward to have a situation allowing me to learn more about it.
* Good knowledge in networking, I did some configurations and troubleshooting.
  I would be happy to learn a lot more on it
* Knowledges concerning the **security**
  * Encryption/decryption algorithms: functioning, usage, upsides/downsides of each of them.
    This includes the operating mode used
    Obviously, I have not seen all of them but I know what and how to check them/choose which to use.
  * I have learning many kind of vulnerabilities and how to avoid/patch them.
  * I have done pentesting as practice exercices, for my work place. I am lacking practice here too.
* Knowledge and practice in assembly (ARM and X86)
* Containers:
  * **Docker** (A lot)
  * **Kubernetes** (Practiced a lot on a few month. I passed the linuxfoundation CKA certification)
  * LXC/LXD (sometimes, but this is a lot easier than docker)
* Cloud plateforms:
  * **Openstack** (public-cloud infomaniak): Every features
  * Digitalocean: Droplets and DBaaS
  * AWS: S3, S3 Glacier, Lambdas and some other features but clearly not all of them
  * Proxmox
  * Jelastic
* Database:
  * I know the SQL language (unflavored)
  * I have used **Postgresql** a lot myself (not with tools or ORM, but with commands)
  * I have set up a Postgresql cluster and did a bit of database management on Postgres (no other DBMS)
  * I have used SQLite, MariaDb (MySQL), MongoDb

## Tools/Platform I have used
* Reverse proxy: Nginx(a lot), Traefik (for docker/kubernetes) and Apache
* Jira for ticketing
* Odoo (ERP): I am working on it since 2018
